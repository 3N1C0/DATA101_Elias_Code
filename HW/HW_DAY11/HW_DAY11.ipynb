    "My graph answers this question by showing the spending of each age group (the colored segments) that make up the total for each area code's bar. I can see that the proportional mix of these colors is visibly different from one area code to the next. For example, the bar for area code 973 has a very large purple segment representing the age group '51+', while the bar for 928 just above it is dominated by the green (age group '36-50') and orange (age group '26-35') segments. This variation shows me the relationship between the area code and the age group, and portrays trends such as how there is less people from the age group '0-18' lego sets compared to the age group '36-50' (note that the data varies so different inferences may be made). This trend makes since logically speaking, as you expect people with older age to have a more steady stream of income, thus allowing them to purchase more lego sets contributing to the total spending.

    "My first article discusses the legislation that the state of Virginia passed requiring human oversight of genertive Artificial Intelligence in court decisions. The article goes in to depth about the ramifications that occur when we train AI models on biased and dscriminatory data. As even though generative AI in the courtroom may intend to reduce these biases, it can in most cases end up misevaluating the situation. The article quotes, \"A separate study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology found that Black and Asian people are anywhere from 10 to 100 times more likely to be misidentified than white people\". These facial recognition softwares have been implemented through various forms of law and military enforcement, and even though this computer vision software has the capabilities to streamline these processes known to be long and arduous, it comes at a cost of integrity. In my opinion (and my opinion alone), I believe both federal and state governments must follow the state of Virginia's footsteps and implement these crucial policies. Without guardrails, the development of AI may go unchecked, as a powerful tool such as it can be misused as a weapon to our judicial system. This article is really a testament to how import data is in machine learning, where the presence of biased data can directly change someones life trajectory, for better or for worse."
