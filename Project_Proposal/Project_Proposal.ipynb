    "This question is important because it tackles the classic, difficult problem of predicting a highly volatile asset. Most simple models fail. This project tests a specific, creative hypothesis: that public interest and \"buzz,\" as measured by Wikipedia edits, might be a valuable predictive signal that traditional price-only models miss. It's a chance to apply data science to a real-world financial puzzle and see if a unique data source can provide a genuine predictive edge."
